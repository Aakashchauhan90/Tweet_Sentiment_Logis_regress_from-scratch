Logistic regression
Supervised Machine Learning & Sentiment Analysis
In supervised machine learning you have input features X and a set of labels Y.

The goal is to minimize your error rates or cost as much as possible.

To do this, run the prediction function which takes in parameters data to map your features to output labels Ŷ.

The best mapping from features to labels is achieved when the difference between the expected values Y and the predicted values Ŷ hat is minimized.

The cost function F does this by comparing how closely the output Ŷ is to the label Y.

Update the parameters and repeat the whole process until your cost is minimized.
